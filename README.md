## Introduction

The Autonomous Trading Bot with AI Agents is a modular, blockchain-based trading platform designed for the Solana ecosystem. The platform leverages automated agent wallets to perform dynamic buy-and-sell cycles using the Jupiter API and Solana blockchain. Our aim is to provide users with a flexible and scalable system for automated trading while laying the groundwork for future integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning-driven strategies.

## Project Overview

This project combines several key functionalities:

- **Wallet Management:**  
  Support for a primary (Root) wallet and multiple agent wallets. Users can generate, import, export, and delete wallets.

- **Agent-Based Trading Automation:**  
  Each agent wallet executes independent trading cycles based on customizable settings such as fixed buy amounts, slippage tolerances, and delays.

- **Blockchain and API Integration:**  
  Seamless interaction with the Solana blockchain for balance checks and transactions, as well as the Jupiter API for real-time token swap quotes and execution.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  An interactive Telegram bot interface allows users to manage wallets, configure trading agents, load funds, and monitor trades via a series of intuitive commands and inline menus.

## Current Features

- **Dynamic Wallet Management:**  
  - Root Wallet: Generate, import, export, and delete.
  - Agent Wallets: Create, manage, and delete up to 10 agents per user.
  
- **Automated Trading Cycle:**  
  - Autonomous buy–then–sell cycles per agent.
  - Configurable parameters per agent (buy amount, sell delay, rest delay, slippage, etc.).
  - Option to toggle the selling function and copy settings between agents.
  
- **Solana & Jupiter Integration:**  
  - Retrieve SOL and token balances.
  - Execute transactions on the Solana blockchain.
  - Retrieve real-time swap quotes and execute swaps via the Jupiter API.
  
- **Load & Withdrawal Operations:**  
  - Transfer funds from the root wallet to agents.
  - Collect excess funds from agents back to the root.
  - Withdraw funds from the root wallet to external addresses.
  
- **Interactive Telegram Interface:**  
  - Command-based and inline keyboard navigation.
  - Real-time notifications on trade execution and system status.
  - Referral system with personalized referral links.

- **Asynchronous Processing:**  
  - Fully asynchronous design allowing multiple agent cycles to run concurrently.
  - Robust error handling and detailed logging.

## Technical Architecture

The project is designed in a modular fashion with the following core components:

1. **Configuration & Global State:**  
   *config.py* – Centralizes environment variables, constants, and global state management.

2. **Database Management:**  
   *database.py* – Handles all CRUD operations and schema management using asyncpg.

3. **Blockchain Integration:**  
   *solana_integration.py* – Manages interactions with the Solana blockchain (balance retrieval, transaction execution).

4. **Jupiter API Integration:**  
   *jupiter_integration.py* – Encapsulates functionality to get quotes and execute token swaps.

5. **Trading Logic:**  
   *trading.py* – Contains the autonomous trading cycle logic for each agent wallet.

6. **Wallet & Agent Management:**  
   *wallet_management.py* & *agent_management.py* – Manage the creation, configuration, and deletion of wallets and agents.

7. **Fund Transfers:**  
   *load_withdrawal.py* – Handles loading funds to agents, collecting funds back, and external withdrawals.

8. **User Interaction Handlers:**  
   *handlers.py* – Implements Telegram command and callback handlers, tying together all modules.

9. **Application Entry Point:**  
   *main.py* – Initializes the application and starts the polling loop.

9. **Security:**  
   *security.py* – Initializes the security of the bot and the database.
